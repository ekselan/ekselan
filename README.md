# Hello!

Thanks for visiting! I'm a data scientist with a passion for data and software engineering, machine learning, and natural language processing. I love working on teams and collaborating on shared visions, but you'll also find many solo projects here as I have a tendency to tinker 💻

Here are some things about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... a machine learning model for use in daily fantasy football! (private)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to create personalized, advanced metrics for dfs analysis
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... projects that involve data engineering or predictive modeling
